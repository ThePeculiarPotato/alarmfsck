- save archives in user's home directory, scan the usual places for it
- allow control over shredding procedure
- but allow for a 'debug' switch that doesn't delete the original files - libreadline?
- perhaps shorten top-level TreeView paths with '/home/user' -> '~'
- allow people to set their own audio files
- set an icon
- port to autoconf
- port to boost::filesystem
- can the pointer in the static trick be made a smart one?
- unit tests?
- extend program to prevent clever users with some really unhealthy sleeping
  patterns suspending the process and recovering the encryption keys from a
  memory dump later in the afternoon. Two communicating processes, one is
  randomly named.

Wilder future prospects:
- try writing a gnome extension that disables volume control
- let the app go full-screen
- extreme option: let the computer boot into a special EFI environment still
  doing all this, say off a USB-stick
