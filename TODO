- encrypt them files
- allow control over shredding procedure
- but allow for a 'debug' switch that doesn't delete the original files - libreadline?
- modify display of the TreeView
    - don't display full paths for children, just file/directory names
    - humanize size numbers (potentially show them added up for dirs)
- address the smaller TODOs in the code
- save archives in user's home directory, scan the usual places for it
- can the pointer in the static trick be made a smart one?
- allow people to set their own audio files
- figure out the license
- set an icon
- port to autoconf
- port to boost::filesystem

Wilder future prospects:
- try writing a gnome extension that disables volume control
- let the app go full-screen
- extreme option: let the computer boot into a special EFI environment still
  doing all this, say off a USB-stick
